# Genre of the Day
This is a small personal project with the goal of making exploration of music genres easier. The python script randomly picks a genre from [Spotify's list of genres](https://gist.github.com/andytlr/4104c667a62d8145aa3a), uses Spotify to find a popular song in that genre, and then posts the cover art and song title to Instagram on the account genre_of_the_day. Using Github actions, this script is scheduled to run daily at roughly 5am EST. 

Posts are made completely automatically. There may be graphic or otherwise inappropriate pictures posted to the genre_of_the_day account. 

NO LONGER RUNNING.
Need to fix: keep 1 instagram login so instagram doesn't get mad about 1 new login every day
