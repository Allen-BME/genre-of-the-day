# Genre of the Day
This is a small personal project with the goal of making exploration of music genres easier. The python script randomly picks a genre from [Spotify's list of genres](https://gist.github.com/andytlr/4104c667a62d8145aa3a), uses Spotify to find a popular song in that genre, and then posts the cover art and song title to Instagram on the account genre_of_the_day. Using Github actions, this script is scheduled to run daily at roughly 5am EST.
